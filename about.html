        FloodDetect's system is designed to function seamlessly in real-time. Our servers continuously gather and
        process rainfall data from multiple sources, while satellite feeds update water level imagery at frequent
        intervals. This near-instant analysis provides a dynamic overview of potential flood zones, enabling
        early-warning notifications to be sent out swiftly.
      </p>
      <p class="justify-text">
        We have developed a user-friendly dashboard where you can track flood forecasts, analyze risk maps, and
        receive immediate alerts. Whether you are a concerned citizen or an emergency coordinator, our platform
        offers intuitive tools that keep you informed and prepared.
